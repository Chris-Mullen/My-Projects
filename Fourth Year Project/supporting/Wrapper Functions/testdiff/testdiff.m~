%% This Function is used to test the difference of two images
%% this is to verify that two images have nothing in common with each other 
%% if the average difference per pixel is zero, this means they are exactly the same image

	a=imread('frames/After.png');
	c=a-b;
	difference=sum(sum(abs(a-b)))/prod(size(a));
	printf('average pixel difference is: %d\n',difference);
	imwrite(c,'diff.png');
